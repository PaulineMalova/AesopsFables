    <string name="The_Ass_And_The_Charger_Text">An Ass congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat, nor even that without hard work.\n\n

But when war broke out, the heavy armed soldier mounted the Horse, and rushed into the very midst of the enemy, and the Horse, being wounded, fell dead on the battle-field.\n\n

Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse, saying: "How much more fortunate am I than a charger. I can remain at home in safety while he is exposed to all the perils of war."</string>

    <string name="The_Bald_Man_And_The_Fly_Text">There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summers day.\n\n

A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.\n\n

The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but his palm came on his head instead.\n\n

Again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said:\n\n

"You will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies."</string>

    <string name="The_Boys_And_The_Frogs_Text">Some boys, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water, and began to pelt them with stones.\n\n

They killed several of them, when one of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water, cried out:\n\n

"Pray stop, my boys; what is sport to you is death to us."\n\n

 </string>

    <string name="The_Camel_And_The_Arab_Text">An Arab Camel-driver having completed the lading of his Camel, asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down hill.\n\n

The poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason: "Why do you ask me? Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?"</string>

    <string name="The_Fisher_Fable_Text">A Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water.\n\n

So he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish.\n\n

Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net.\n\n

"Ah, you dance now when I play," said he.\n\n

"Yes," said an old Fish: "When you are in a man's power you must do as he bids you."</string>

    <string name="The_Lion_And_The_Mouse_Text">Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.\n\n

"Pardon, O King," cried the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"\n\n

The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.\n\n

Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on.\n\n

Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.\n\n

"Was I not right?" said the little Mouse.</string>

    <string name="The_Lion_In_Love_Text">A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents.\n\n

The old people did not know what to say.\n\n

They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.\n\n

At last the father said:\n\n

"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again."\n\n

The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.\n\n

But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.</string>

    <string name="The_Mischievous_Dog_Text">A Dog used to run up quietly to the heels of those he met, and to bite them without notice.\n\n

His master sometimes suspended a bell about his neck, that he might give notice of his presence wherever he went, and sometimes he fastened a chain about his neck, to which was attached a heavy clog, so that he could not be so quick at biting peoples heels.\n\n

The Dog grew proud of his bell and clog, and went with them all over the market-place.\n\n

An old hound said to him: "Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell and clog that you carry are not, believe me, orders of merit, but, on the contrary, marks of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill-mannered dog."</string>

    <string name="The_Old_Man_And_Death_Text">An old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest.\n\n

At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: \n\n

"I cannot bear this life any longer. Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!"\n\n

As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him:\n\n

"What wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me."\n\n

"Please, sir," replied the woodcutter,\n\n

"Would you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?"</string>

    <string name="The_Vain_Jackdaw_Text">Jupiter determined, it is said, to create a sovereign over the birds, and made proclamation that, on a certain day, they should all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king.\n\n

The Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body.\n\n

When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many-feathered finery.\n\n

On Jupiter proposing to make him king, on account of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucking from him his own feathers, the Jackdaw was again nothing but a Jackdaw.</string>
